Founded in 2013
Chime was founded by Chris Britt (CEO) and Ryan King (CTO) 
Idea came about as an alternative to traditional banking. Wanted to help millienials save hundreds a year on banking and gain control of their financial lives.
### Business Activities
Chime was created with the mission of encouraging smart spending and saving. Chime wanted to help millienials save hundreds a year on banking and gain control of their financial lives.
The company’s business model —  essentially, a technology layer on top of an account that’s actually from a separate FDIC-backed institution — allows it to focus on making money from debit transactions and a premium subscription. Most traditional banks require customers to keep thousands of dollars in balances to avoid maintenance fees.
Chime offers various fee-free banking products, including checking accounts with no minimum balance, an automated savings feature, and early wage access. In September 2019, Chime launched SpotMe, a fee-free overdraft service where customers can overdraw their accounts up to $100 without incurring an overdraft fee; once the overdraft limit is reached, purchases will be declined but no traditional negative balance fees charged
Market size appears to be very large as customer base is primarily millenials, which currently has 72.1MM people and is cosnidered the largets population group.

###Results
While big banks such as Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) have lost tens of billions of says it is signing up hundreds of thousands of new customers each month, and some of them are ditching big banks altogether for Chime.
Core metrics for companies in this domain to measure sucess are new users/account openings. Already growing fast before the pandemic hit, Chime saw average transaction volume rise 50% year-over-year in 2020. In just 18 months, Chime's private market valuation has spiked by a staggering 1,015% to $14.5 billion
Other companies in this domain are experiencing exponential growth, like Chime, but Chime is one of the fatest grwothing companies in this domain. 
###Recommendations
My recommendation for Chime would be to incorporate a lending platorm. Given the technolgoy platform they already have, Chime currently has significant data on exisitng customers. Chime could build a computer program that could auto-approve customer's for certain loans, based on their checking and spending habits. This program would need to use porgramiing to setup a system that could automaitcally offer customers loans for cars, boats, houses, and other big ticket itmes. A computer program that could accomplish this task would be necessary, as many of the customers currently flocking to Chime want instant feedback/access to financial tools.
